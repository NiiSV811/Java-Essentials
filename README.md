# JAVA ESSENTIALS #
*Aclaration: I'm a begginer in programming world, also, I'm actually learning English. If I wrong, I'll glad that You correct the mistakes* :sweat_smile: :grin:

In this repository, you will find some examples of Java essentials. You are free to use the examples for learning and experiment.

Ok, let's start. :relaxed:

Java is a programming language developed by Oracle(Sun Microsystems). Some features of Java:
+ General purpose
+ Multiparadigm (Imperative, OOP, functional ...)
+ Hybrid Compiled: Java compiled a file called Bytecode, this file runs in a VM (JVM)
+ Multiplatform (Windows, Mac, IoS, Linux, Android...)
+ It was one of the most famous programming Languages :sunglasses:

Lastest release: JDK 19
Lastest Long-Term Support realese: JDK 17

# VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES #

Variables are like boxes, with they we can store some stuff, but in real life exist a lot of type of boxes designed to store different stuff. In java exists different data types.

## PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES ##
+ Integer: stores whole numbers e.g 5 , 20 , 125 , 300.
  + *byte*      (8  bits)
  + *short*     (16 bits) 
  + *int*      (32 bits)
  + *long*      (64 bits)
+ Floating point: stores numbers with decimals e.g 2.41 ; 3,14159 ; 4,2.
  + *double*   (64 bits)
  + *float*   (32 bits)
+ *boolean* (1 bit): Stores true or false values
+ *char* (1 bit): Stores single characters e.g 'A' , '@' , '3' , 'z'.
+ *String *: Stores a collection of characters e.g "Hi How are You?" , "P@ssword 1234" , "lorem ipus .."
With this data types, we can solve a lot of problems and create
